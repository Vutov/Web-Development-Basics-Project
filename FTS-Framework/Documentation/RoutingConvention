Default Routing is 'package/controller/method/param[0]/param[1]'

It can be override with annotations.

Example: @Route("Custom/{id:int}/Route") - where in '{ ValueName : Type (int, string) }' can be placed param.

Custom routers can be given using the fluent App class.
Example: App::getInstance()->setRouter(new DummyRouter());
NOTE this must be done BEFORE the app is running. At that point there is no autoloader, so you have to include
the files yourself.
